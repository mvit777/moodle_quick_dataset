## Moodle Quick DataSet

### Prequel
Back in 2018 I wanted to give a try to the Students at risk of dropping out model which is part of Moodle's Learning Analytics.
As per their definition:

>This model predicts students who are at risk of non-completion (dropping out) of a Moodle course, based on low student engagement.

>In this model, the definition of "dropping out" is "no student activity in the last quarter of the course." 
>This prediction model uses the Community of Inquiry model of student engagement, consisting of three parts:
>
> - Cognitive presence
> - Social presence
> - Teacher presence
