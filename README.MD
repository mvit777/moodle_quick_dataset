## Moodle Quick DataSet

### Prequel
Back in 2018 I wanted to give a try to the [Students at risk of dropping out](https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/Students_at_risk_of_dropping_out)  model which is part of [Moodle's Learning Analytics](https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/Analytics).
As per their definition:

>This model predicts students who are at risk of non-completion (dropping out) of a Moodle course, based on low student engagement.

>In this model, the definition of "dropping out" is "no student activity in the last quarter of the course." 
>This prediction model uses the Community of Inquiry model of student engagement, consisting of three parts:
>
> - Cognitive presence
> - Social presence
> - Teacher presence


I also had a plan (now totally de-railed mainly due to lack of time) to code a plugin which would cross-check the model's output against the output of one or more gamification plugin, ideally through the use of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

The first thing I needed was a lot of data.
